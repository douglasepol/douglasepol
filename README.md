I work in Data Engineering and Data Analysis and hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. I have experience designing ETL pipelines, automating reporting processes, and building data visualizations that support decision-making. I've contributed to both public and private sector projects, working with international teams to deliver practical, data-driven solutions.

Iâ€™ve developed data pipelines using Python, SQL, and Pentaho, integrated data across PostgreSQL and Oracle, and created interactive dashboards with Looker, Power BI, and Streamlit. My work has supported large-scale operations, including payroll processing for over 110,000 individuals, with a focus on data consistency and automated reporting.

In a separate project, I contributed to data integration and analysis in PostgreSQL, helping the commercial team recover inactive clients and generating over USD 200,000 in additional revenue. I also led a field research team of 15 people in a socioeconomic survey that delivered medical, social, and economic assistance to more than 500 underserved residents.

These experiences have shaped my ability to deliver scalable, well-documented solutions focused on clarity, reliability, and business value.

I'm interested in challenges related to Data Engineering, Data Analysis, and Backend Development.

Technologies I frequently work with: Python, SQL, Pentaho, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Looker, Power BI, AWS, Git.
