I have experience with ETL processes, data management, and technical teaching. My skills include advanced use of technologies such as Python, PostgreSQL, Oracle, AWS, Looker Data Studio, and Linux. My approach is based on analytical problem-solving, adaptability, and continuous learning, allowing me to navigate effectively between various functions and technologies.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in leading strategic projects and effectively managing teams and technologies.

One of my main projects involved identifying investors, which resulted in an increase of over US$ 200,000 in company revenue. Additionally, I managed the development of dashboards in Looker Data Studio, significantly enhancing real-time data-driven decision-making.

My experience also includes leading a team of 15 people in a socioeconomic research project for state strategic planning, benefiting more than 500 people.

Complementing these initiatives, I administered Linux servers to maintain MOODLE learning environments, supporting approximately 15,000 active users.
